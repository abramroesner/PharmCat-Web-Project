# PharmCat-Web-Project
This repository is dedicated to the development of a genomic tool powered by PharmCat to allow the general public to evaluate their genomic data at little to no cost. 
Currently the large alignment files have been removed from this repository due to size constraints. 
Without these files the program will not work - that said they are readily accessable online at the pharmcat repo and the Ensembl assembly file for GRCH37
